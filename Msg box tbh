You can change what is in the commas to anything above.
To make an example error message you would use
    x= msgbox("An error has occurred!",0+16,"ERROR")
You can also be a dick and loop it so you cant close it without going into task manager.
     do
     x= msgbox("Lol, im being a dick and not letting you close this message HAHA faggot.",0+64,"Lollololololollollololo")
     loop
 Make sure you put do on top and loop on bottom or else you will get an error.
     To get rid of it you cant just click the x or OK, you will have to go into task manager by either pressing ctrl+alt+del and clicking task manager
     or, press ctrl+shift+esc and go to processes and click wscript.exe and then click delete.
